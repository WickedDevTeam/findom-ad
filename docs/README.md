4. Visit `http://localhost:8080` to view the application

For more detailed instructions, please refer to the specific documentation sections.

## Development Workflow

The recommended workflow for developing new features:

1. **Understand Requirements** - Review the feature specification
2. **Plan Implementation** - Design the component structure and data flow
3. **Implement Components** - Create and style UI components
4. **Implement Data Layer** - Connect components to the data layer using hooks
5. **Test** - Verify functionality and responsiveness
6. **Document** - Update documentation with new features or changes

## Contribution Guidelines

When contributing to this project:

1. Follow the established coding style and patterns
2. Write clear, descriptive commit messages
3. Document new components and hooks
4. Ensure responsive design works across device sizes
5. Test on multiple browsers if possible

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Authentication Issues

If users encounter authentication issues:
- Verify that Supabase site URL and redirect URLs are configured correctly
- Check that the user's session is being properly maintained
- Inspect network requests for any API errors

### Data Visibility Issues

If data isn't appearing as expected:
- Verify Row Level Security (RLS) policies are correctly configured
- Check that the user has the necessary permissions
- Verify the data query includes all required fields

### Performance Problems

If the application feels slow:
- Check for unnecessary re-renders using React DevTools
- Verify that React Query is configured optimally
- Ensure large lists are virtualized
- Optimize image loading and size
