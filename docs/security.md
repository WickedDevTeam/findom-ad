# Security Documentation

This document outlines the security measures and best practices implemented in the Findom Directory application.

## Authentication Security

### Supabase Authentication

The application uses Supabase Authentication, which provides:

- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication
- Token refresh mechanisms
- Session management
- Protection against common authentication attacks

### Token Management

Authentication tokens are handled with the following security measures:

- Access tokens (JWT) are short-lived (1 hour by default)
- Refresh tokens are stored securely and rotated regularly
- Token validation on both client and server
- Token revocation on logout

### Session Handling

Sessions are managed securely with:

- Server-side session validation
- Automatic session refreshing
- Session termination on logout
- Protection against session fixation attacks

## Data Security

### Row Level Security (RLS)

All database tables are protected with Row Level Security policies that:

- Restrict data access based on user identity
- Enforce ownership-based permissions
- Allow admin override for maintenance
- Prevent unauthorized data manipulation

Example RLS policy for user-owned data:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profiles" 
ON profiles FOR SELECT 
USING (auth.uid() = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profiles" 
ON profiles FOR UPDATE 
USING (auth.uid() = id);
```

### Database Schema Security

The database schema is designed with security in mind:

- Separation of public and private data
- Foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity
- Validation checks to ensure data quality
- Function-based security for complex operations

### API Security

All API calls are secured through:

- JWT authentication for user-specific operations
- RLS policies enforced at the database level
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks

## Frontend Security

### XSS Prevention

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are mitigated by:

- Using React's automatic escaping of rendered content
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Avoiding dangerous patterns like `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
- Validating and sanitizing user input

### CSRF Protection

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection is implemented through:

- Token-based authentication
- SameSite cookie attributes
- Origin checking for sensitive operations

## Content Security

### User Generated Content

User-generated content is secured by:

- Content validation before storage
- Sanitization of HTML content (if allowed)
- Image uploads limited to approved formats and sizes
- Storage in isolated buckets with appropriate access controls

### Storage Security

File storage is secured with:

- Configurable file size limits
- File type validation
- Signed URLs for file access
- Expiring links for sensitive content
- Isolation between user content

## Admin Security

### Admin Authentication

Admin accounts have additional security measures:

- Role-based access control
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) recommended
- Admin action logging
- Restricted admin operations

### Privileged Operations

Operations that require admin privileges are protected by:

- Server-side role verification
- Function-level security checks using `is_admin()` function
- Audit logs of administrative actions
- Clear separation of admin and regular user interfaces

## Environment Security

### Secret Management

Application secrets are managed securely:

- Supabase secrets stored in a secure environment
- No secrets in client-side code
- Environment-specific configuration
- Rotation policies for critical secrets

### Deployment Security

Deployment practices follow security best practices:

- HTTPS for all communications
- Strict Content-Security-Policy headers
- X-Frame-Options to prevent clickjacking
- Appropriate CORS configuration
- Regular security updates

## Security Monitoring

### Audit Logging

The application includes audit logging for security events:

- Authentication successes and failures
- Admin operations
- Sensitive data access
- Content moderation actions

### Error Handling

Secure error handling prevents information disclosure:

- Generic error messages for users
- Detailed logs for debugging (not exposed to users)
- Graceful failure that doesn't reveal system details
- Rate limiting on authentication attempts

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Protection

The application is designed with data protection principles:

- Minimal data collection
- Purpose-specific data usage
- User consent for data processing
- Data export functionality
- Account deletion capability

### Privacy Features

Privacy features include:

- Privacy policy documentation
- Cookie consent mechanism
- Data retention policies
- User data access controls

## Security Recommendations

### Recommended Security Enhancements

For production deployments, consider implementing:

1. **Multi-factor Authentication** - Add an additional layer of security for account access
2. **Enhanced Rate Limiting** - Protect against brute force and DoS attacks
3. **Security Headers** - Implement additional security headers like HSTS
4. **Vulnerability Scanning** - Regular automated scanning for security issues
5. **Security Monitoring** - Implement real-time monitoring for suspicious activities

### Security Best Practices for Development

Developers working on the project should follow these security practices:

1. Never commit secrets or credentials to version control
2. Keep dependencies updated to patch security vulnerabilities
3. Follow the principle of least privilege when creating database roles
4. Validate all user input, both on the client and server
5. Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
6. Regularly review and audit security configurations

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Handling

In case of a security incident:

1. Identify and isolate the affected systems
2. Assess the impact and scope of the breach
3. Contain the incident and prevent further damage
4. Investigate the root cause
5. Remediate vulnerabilities and restore systems
6. Notify affected users if required
7. Document the incident and improve security measures
